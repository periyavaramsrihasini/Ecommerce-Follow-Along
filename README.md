# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
Ecommerce-Follow-Along is a guided project designed to help developers build a full-stack e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project covers essential features such as user authentication, product management, order handling, and RESTful API development.  

By following along, you will gain hands-on experience in designing database schemas, implementing API endpoints, and creating a responsive frontend interface.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

### What We Covered:
1. *Introduction to the MERN Stack*  
   - Understanding how MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js work together.
   
2. *Project Setup & Structure*  
   - Setting up a new GitHub repository.  
   - Initializing the project with 'package.json' and installing dependencies.  
   - Structuring the project into 'client' (React) and 'server' (Express) directories.  

3. *Core Features Overview*  
   - *User Authentication:* Secure login and registration using JWT.  
   - *Product Management:* CRUD operations with filtering and sorting.  
   - *Order Handling:* Allowing users to place and manage orders.  
   - *REST API Development:* Implementing API endpoints for managing products, users, and orders.  
   - *Frontend UI:* Building a responsive interface using React.  

Next Steps:  
- Set up the database connection with MongoDB.  
- Implement JWT-based authentication.  
- Develop initial API endpoints for users and products.
