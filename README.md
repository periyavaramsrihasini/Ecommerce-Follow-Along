# Project Overview: E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack )

This project will guide you through building  full-stack E-commerce website  using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Admin users can manage products, view orders, and update inventory.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux, React Router
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcryptjs
- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe
- **State Management:** Redux for managing app state
- **Deployment:** Heroku (or any cloud provider like AWS)

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** 
  - Register, login, and logout functionality with secure password storage using bcryptjs.
  - JWT-based authentication to manage sessions.
  
- **Product Management:**
  - Display products with sorting and filtering options based on categories, price, ratings, etc.
  - Admin panel to add, update, or delete products.

- **Shopping Cart:**
  - Add products to the cart, view cart details, and update item quantities.
  - Display total prices and calculate shipping fees.

- **Checkout Process:**
  - Integration with Stripe for secure payment processing.
  - Users can review their order and proceed with payment.

- **Order Management:**
  - Users can view their order history and track current orders.
  - Admin can update order status (Pending, Shipped, Delivered).

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Fully responsive UI to support different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

- **Search and Filter:**
  - Search products by name and filter by categories, price range, and ratings.

- **Security Features:**
  - Input validation and data sanitization.
  - HTTPS support for secure data transmission.



# Milestone 1: 

In a MERN stack application, login and sign-up (authentication) typically involve a process where users can register (sign-up) with their credentials, and later log in using those credentials. The login and sign-up process can be divided into several steps, with separate client-side (React) and server-side (Node.js/Express) handling.

# Milestone 2:

# Login Page - README

## Overview

This is a simple **Login Page** built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The page includes a form where users can enter their **email** and **password**, along with a **"Remember me"** checkbox and a **"Forgot Password?"** link. It uses **React's `useState` hook** to manage the form's state (email and password).

## Key Features

- **Email & Password Fields**: Users can enter their credentials for login.
- **Remember Me Checkbox**: Allows users to stay logged in on future visits.
- **Forgot Password Link**: A link for users who have forgotten their password.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both mobile and desktop.
- **React State Management**: Utilizes `useState` to handle form values for email and password.

## Milestone 3: Backend Setup

### Progress:
- Set up the project folder structure with routes, controllers, models, middlewares, and utilities.
- Created a Node.js server with Express.
- Connected the server to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- Added error handling middleware for better debugging.
- 

## Milestone 4 Overview

### In this milestone, the following features were implemented:

- User Model Creation: A new User model was created to represent user data in the database, including necessary fields such as name, email, password, etc.
- Multer Integration: Multer was integrated to handle file uploads (e.g., profile images, documents, etc.). Multer handles multipart/form-data, which is used for uploading files in Node.js applications.



## Milestone 5: Sign-Up Page Implementation

In this milestone, I have created a Sign-Up page with the following features:
- A user-friendly form for entering Name, **Email, **Password, and **Confirm Password.
- Form validation to ensure:
  - All fields are filled.
  - The email is valid.
  - The password meets the minimum length requirement and matches the confirm password field.
- Upon successful form submission, the user is redirected to the Login page.

Technologies used:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router

## Milestone 6: Backend endpoint for the Signup page to store all user data securely

In this milestone, I have implemented User Authentication for the backend with the following features:

- Password Encryption
- User Signup via Endpoint
- Tested Endpoints Using Postman GET & POST Requests

Technologies Used:
- MongoDB & Mongoose (Database & ORM)
- bcrypt.js (Password encryption)
- jsonwebtoken (JWT) (Authentication)


## Milestone 7: Backend endpoint for the Login page to store all user data securely and Implementation

In this milestone, we focus on creating a login endpoint for user authentication. This includes:

- Accepting User Credentials
- Password Hashing
- Compare Hashed Passwords
- Credentials Store in Database (MongoDB)

Technologies Used:
- MongoDB & Mongoose (Database & ORM)
- bcrypt.js (Password encryption)

## Milestone 8:Card Componenet & Homepage Layout
In this milestone, we focused on creating a Card Component and Homepage Layout. This Includes:
Resusable Product card Component
Responsive Grid Layout
Tailwind CSS Styling for Home Page

## Milestone 9: Product Management Frontend
In this milestone we focused on Interacting with product API, Where users can add and view products in a simple UI, This Includes:
Display a form to add products
Form to add a new product
Connects to Express & MongoDB API

## Milestone 10: Product API
In this milestone, We focused on Validation and Store Product Details Using Express and MongoDB API Using Mongoose Library
Create a Product with name, descriptions, price and Image URL
Validates input before storing data in MongoDB
RESTful POST endpoint to add products

# Milestone 11: Dynamic Home Page

## Welcome to Milestone 11! ðŸŒŸ

Today, we will make our home page that will display all the products dynamic. We will write an endpoint that will send all the data that was saved in MongoDB using the add products page earlier.

### Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯
By the end of this milestone, you will:
- Understand how to write an endpoint that will extract and send data from MongoDB.
- Learn how to receive data at the frontend.
- Learn how to display that data dynamically using the product card component created earlier.

# Milestone 12: My Products Page

## Overview
In this milestone, we created a "My Products" page that displays all the products added by the user, filtered by their email.

## Features
- **Backend**: Added an endpoint to fetch products by user email.
- **Frontend**: Created a function to retrieve and display products dynamically.
- **Component**: Utilized the `Card` component to present each product.

# Milestone 13: Edit Product Functionality

## Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯
- Write an endpoint to update existing data in MongoDB.
- Autofill forms with previous data for editing.

# Milestone 14: Delete Product Functionality

## Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯

- Deletes the product from the page

## Milestone 15: Navbar Component for Every Screen Page in Frontend

- Added Navbar for all pages includes HomePage, Products page, login/Signup page, and Product form

- Made full responsive for both desktop and mobile view and styled using tailwind CSS


## Milestone 16: Product Info Page

- Implemented a product info page that fetches and displays detailed product information based on the product ID from the URL.

- Applied a professional dark blue theme using Tailwind CSS.

- Implemented event handlers for quantity changes, add-to-cart, buy-now, and like actions.
